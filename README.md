# I didn't finish this project. 

I determined that Pipex would be more useful to me in minishell than minitalk. 
This project is rather simple in that the method for its completion is simply translating SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 
bits, and then placing those bits into an integer to be interpreted as a char. I might finish this at some
point just to have this repository not be entirely useless.
